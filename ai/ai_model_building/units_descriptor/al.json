For a thousand years, our Order has been among those tasked with the safety of the Empire, by keeping vigil upon the border and responding with devastating force against any incursion.Our outriders are fleet and well provisioned, with remounts available along the roads to Aschau. It is a hard life, with many dangers, but they are highly effective. In 842, late in the year, we rode to intercept a warband. The beacons had been lit, their flames blazing bright in the early morning gloom. Word had been dispatched to the capital, yet by the reports, we would disperse the raid in short order.Arriving at the Donegar Beacon, we found the warband arrayed against us, banners showing a cloven skull. Their numbers were as described---a challenging prospect, but I rode with seasoned troops. We levelled lances, moving naturally into flanking positions, and struck hard. The battle was bloody. Good soldiers fell beside me, but we broke their lines, circling to launch another attack.The intervention of the giant changed everything. One moment we were routing the broken remnants of a defeated force. The next, they turned to face us once more, reforming, as the great Beacon tower itself shook and creaked. With a cracking sound like a cannon, it fell thunderously to the ground, shattering our right flank. The figure that loomed in the Beacon's stead bellowed incoherently, raising a hand, and two more of my comrades fell beneath a lash of green energy. The retreat was called, though in truth it was a flight. Months would pass before the Beacon was restored, and we would not be the last to feel the giant's wrath.\n\tBeacons of Light: Tales from the Border\\Knight Commander Ingolf Ehlers' memoirs, 860 A.S.\n",
